/**
 * Layouts are concerned with the relationship of components to each other. They
 * should not be concerned with the styling of the components themselves.
 *
 * While layouts can be page layouts, like a layout with a header, sidebar, and
 * footer, most layouts are micro-layouts with a narrow purpose. For example,
 * the stack layout only applies a margin in between its child elements.
 *
 * The styles of a layout should be scoped by a single class. Modifier
 * classes should be named `is-*` or `has-*` (not `are-*` or `have-*`).
 *
 *     .some-layout {
 *       --max-width: 40rem;
 *
 *       display: flex;
 *       max-width: var(--max-width);
 *       gap: f.spacer(4);
 *
 *       &.is-narrow {
 *         --max-width: 10rem;
 *       }
 *     }
